# speckit.implement Prompt

## Purpose
Route requests to the speckit.implement prompt in `.codex/prompts/speckit.implement.md`.

## Workflow
1. Open `.codex/prompts/speckit.implement.md`.
2. Follow the instructions in that prompt when responding to the user.
3. If the prompt is missing, tell the user the file is not present and ask whether to create it.
